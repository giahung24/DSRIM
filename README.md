# DSRIM  
This code provides only DSRIM network architecture and training process. You must prepare the vectors data in order to test the network. 

There is some comments in code to help understanding functions. If you have any question concerning the source code, feel free to contact the author or open a github issue.

## Dependencies
Our network is made with Torch 7 framework. These packages is required in the codes:
- torch
- nninit
- nn
- optim
